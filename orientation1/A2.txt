The operational system of a supermarket would include a database of items. Each item associated with an id and price. A database of purchases that would include the id of what was bought, the quantity that was bought and the buyer. The final price would be gained from the database of purchases by using the item id reference to get the item price, then counting all of them together for the sum total.
